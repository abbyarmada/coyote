<h1>Coyote Batch</h1>

<h2>What it can do for you</h2>
<p>Coyote Batch is a simplified data extraction, transform and loading toolkit 
	for the Java[tm] platform. It uses a very modular architecture that lets 
	you add your own components so the tool works as you want, not as the 
	software requires it to work. It is possible to extend it to suit your needs
	and has been designed with this purpose in mind from the start.</p>

<h2>ToolKit, Not a Framework</h2>
<p>This is a collection of tools which can be used individually or in concert 
	to achieve the level of functionality desired. Just need to read fixed 
	field length files? Just use the the classis in your code to do so. Want a 
	more complete conversion routine? Use the Transform Engine to handle a more 
	sophisticated conversion.</p>
