Contains implementations of the ClientCache interface.

<p>An MQTT client needs a caching mechanism to store messages while they are in 
the process of being delivered. This package contains implementations of the 
interface. If a caching class is not specified on the constructor to an MQTT 
client, FileCaching is used by default.
