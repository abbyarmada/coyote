Contains a programming interface enabling applications to communicate with an MQTT server.

<p>
The MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a lightweight broker-based publish/subscribe 
messaging protocol designed to be open, simple, lightweight and easy to implement. 
These characteristics make it ideal for use in constrained environments, for example, 
but not limited to:<ul>
<li>Where the network is expensive, has low bandwidth or is unreliable such as mobile and vsat networks
<li>When run on an embedded or mobile device with limited processor, memory or battery
</ul>
<p>Features of the protocol include:<ul>
  <li>The publish/subscribe message pattern to provide one-to-many message 
  distribution and decoupling of applications
  <li>A messaging transport that is agnostic to the content of the payload
  <li>The use of TCP/IP to provide network connectivity
  <li>The use of SSL/TLS to provide network security and trust
  <li>Three qualities of service for message delivery which are maintained across 
  network, client and server breaks.<ul>
    <li>"At most once", where messages are delivered according to the best efforts 
     of the underlying TCP/IP network. Message loss or duplication can occur. 
     This level could be used, for example, with ambient sensor data where it 
     does not matter if an individual reading is lost as the next one will be published soon after.
    <li>"At least once", where messages are assured to arrive but duplicates may occur.
    <li>"Exactly once", where message are assured to arrive exactly once. This 
     level could be used, for example, with billing systems where duplicate or 
     lost messages could lead to incorrect charges being applied.
  </ul>
  The quality of service for message delivery is met even if the network connection 
  breaks, or the client or the server stop while a message is being delivered
  <li>A small transport overhead (the fixed-length header is just 2 bytes), and 
   protocol exchanges minimized to reduce network traffic
  <li>A mechanism to notify interested parties to an abnormal disconnection of
   a client using the Last Will and Testament feature
</ul>
