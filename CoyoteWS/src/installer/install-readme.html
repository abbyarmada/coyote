<h2>What it can do for you</h2>

	can be added to the Coyote Batch tool kit to aid in creation of data 
	extraction, transformation and loading jobs. While these file transfer tools
	are targeted to the Coyote Batch tool kit, these classes can be used in other 
	components to speed the development process.</p>

<h2>ToolKit, Not a Framework</h2>

	to achieve the level of functionality desired. Just need to copy a directory
	form one location to another? Just use the components in this toolkit. For
