# CoyoteJS

This project allows you to run your own scripts in processing data being transferred. Specifically, you can run JavaScript to implement your business logic instead of compiling your components and including them in the classpath.

You can write scripts to do the following:
* Transform data before it is written
* Filter data based on scripted business logic
* Have your scripts called at specific stages in the process for each record with a listener
* Any phase of the project / component type can scripted. - when the project is released.
